        <h2>C-A-L Ranch Stores</h2>
        <p>
          C-A-L Ranch Stores was founded in 1959 in Idaho Falls, ID, by Clinton,
          Allen, and L. Wayne Murphy. The family used their initials “C-A-L to
          create their brand. Their first store, located in Idaho Falls, ID was
          called C-A-L Ranch & Farm Supply. The store had less than 3,000 square
          feet and the primary products sold were tillage tools and hardware.
          Due to the store’s popularity, it was relocated to a 6,000 square foot
          building in its second year of operation. That same year, a second
          store was opened in Rexburg, ID. C-A-L Ranch Stores continued its
          expansion in 1967 by acquiring the stores of Farm & City in Blackfoot,
          Pocatello, and Burley, ID while simultaneously expanding its
          merchandise assortment to include apparel. <br />
          <br />
          On June 8, 1998, C-A-L Ranch Store opened the first Utah store in
          Logan. Between 1998 and 2002, the company opened additional stores in
          Spanish Fork, American Fork, Farr West, Tooele, and Cedar City, UT.
          They now have 26 locations throughout Idaho, Utah, Arizona and Nevada.

          Goals: <br />
          <br />
          The area around Idaho Falls was first sparsely settled by cattle and
          sheep ranchers. No significant development took place until 1864, when
          a man named Harry Rickets built and operated a ferry on the Snake
          River. The ferry served a new tide of westward migration and travel on
          the Montana Trail following the Bear River Massacre of Shoshone
          Indians in 1863.
          <br />
          <br />
          Purpose:
          <br />
          <br />
          The present-day site of Idaho Falls became a permanent settlement when
          freighter Matt Taylor built a timber-frame toll bridge across a narrow
          black basaltic gorge of the river 7 miles (11 km) downstream from the
          ferry. The bridge improved travel for settlers moving north and west,
          and for miners, freighters, and others seeking riches in the gold
          fields of Idaho and Montana—especially the boom towns of Bannack and
          Virginia City.

        <h2>Idaho Falls Could See Population Boom in Next 10 Years</h2>
        <p class="homeText">
          <img
            id="art-image"
            src="/idahofallscoc/images/cam_house.jpg"

          />
          City experts expect the new U.S. Census to show Idaho Falls with its
          usual steady growth of about 1.5 to 2%, but they are bracing for a
          possible major boom in population possibly doubling the city’s size
          over the next decade.
          <br /><br />
          Brad Cramer, director of Community Development Services Department for
          Idaho Falls, points to the potential of the small modular reactor
          project at the Idaho National Laboratory desert site and the rise of
          the “Zoom towns” phenomenon across the West to cause a major influx
          for Idaho Falls and surrounding towns.
          <br /><br />“We feel like we’re primed to see a boom,” Cramer said.
          “The biggest booms we’ve had are when the INL came to town. We doubled
          not only in population but in landmass. ... We might not double in
          population, that might be farfetched over the next decade, but it’s
          also not unthinkable.”<br /><br />Cramer pegs Idaho Falls’ current
          population in the mid to high 60,000 range, which would put it about
          14 percent higher than its 2010 Census of 56,813. The Census Bureau
          estimated the city’s population at 61,535 in 2018. That put it as the
          state’s fourth-largest city and largest outside of the Treasure
          Valley. Eastern Idaho continues to log steady growth, with towns such
          as Ammon growing at nearly twice the rate as Idaho Falls. Ammon topped
          16,000 for the first time in 2019. <br /><br />
