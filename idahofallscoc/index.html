          <h2>C-A-L Ranch Stores</h2>
          <p>
            C-A-L Ranch Stores was founded in 1959 in Idaho Falls, ID, by
            Clinton, Allen, and L. Wayne Murphy. The family used their initials
            “C-A-L to create their brand. Their first store, located in Idaho
            Falls, ID was called C-A-L Ranch & Farm Supply. The store had less
            than 3,000 square feet and the primary products sold were tillage
            tools and hardware. Due to the store’s popularity, it was relocated
            to a 6,000 square foot building in its second year of operation.
            That same year, a second store was opened in Rexburg, ID. C-A-L
            Ranch Stores continued its expansion in 1967 by acquiring the stores
            of Farm & City in Blackfoot, Pocatello, and Burley, ID while
            simultaneously expanding its merchandise assortment to include
            apparel.
            <br />
            <br />
            On June 8, 1998, C-A-L Ranch Store opened the first Utah store in
            Logan. Between 1998 and 2002, the company opened additional stores
            in Spanish Fork, American Fork, Farr West, Tooele, and Cedar City,
            UT. They now have 26 locations throughout Idaho, Utah, Arizona and
            Nevada.

          <h2>Idaho Falls Could See Population Boom in Next 10 Years</h2>
          <p class="homeText">
            <img
              id="art-image"
              src="/idahofallscoc/images/cam_house.jpg"
              alt="Moving"
            />
            City experts expect the new U.S. Census to show Idaho Falls with its
            usual steady growth of about 1.5 to 2%, but they are bracing for a
            possible major boom in population possibly doubling the city’s size
            over the next decade.
            <br /><br />
            Brad Cramer, director of Community Development Services Department
            for Idaho Falls, points to the potential of the small modular
            reactor project at the Idaho National Laboratory desert site and the
            rise of the “Zoom towns” phenomenon across the West to cause a major
            influx for Idaho Falls and surrounding towns.
            <br /><br />“We feel like we’re primed to see a boom,” Cramer said.
            “The biggest booms we’ve had are when the INL came to town. We
            doubled not only in population but in landmass. ... We might not
            double in population, that might be farfetched over the next decade,
            but it’s also not unthinkable.”<br /><br />Cramer pegs Idaho Falls’
            current population in the mid to high 60,000 range, which would put
            it about 14 percent higher than its 2010 Census of 56,813. The
            Census Bureau estimated the city’s population at 61,535 in 2018.
            That put it as the state’s fourth-largest city and largest outside
            of the Treasure Valley. Eastern Idaho continues to log steady
            growth, with towns such as Ammon growing at nearly twice the rate as
            Idaho Falls. Ammon topped 16,000 for the first time in 2019.
