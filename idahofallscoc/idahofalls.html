        <h2>Last Week's Trivia Explained</h2>
        <p class="trivText">
          The area around Idaho Falls was first sparsely settled by cattle and
          sheep ranchers. No significant development took place until 1864, when
          a man named Harry Rickets built and operated a ferry on the Snake
          River. The ferry served a new tide of westward migration and travel on
          the Montana Trail following the Bear River Massacre of Shoshone
          Indians in 1863.
          <br />
          <br />
          The present-day site of Idaho Falls became a permanent settlement when
          freighter Matt Taylor built a timber-frame toll bridge across a narrow
          black basaltic gorge of the river 7 miles (11 km) downstream from the
          ferry. The bridge improved travel for settlers moving north and west,
          and for miners, freighters, and others seeking riches in the gold
          fields of Idaho and Montana—especially the boom towns of Bannack and
          Virginia City.

        <h2>Idaho Falls Could See Population Boom in Next 10 Years</h2>
        <p class="articleText">
          <img
            id="art-image"
            src="/idahofallscoc/images/cam_house.jpg"
            alt="Moving"
          />
          City experts expect the new U.S. Census to show Idaho Falls with its
          usual steady growth of about 1.5 to 2%, but they are bracing for a
          possible major boom in population possibly doubling the city’s size
          over the next decade.
          <br /><br />
          Brad Cramer, director of Community Development Services Department for
          Idaho Falls, points to the potential of the small modular reactor
          project at the Idaho National Laboratory desert site and the rise of
          the “Zoom towns” phenomenon across the West to cause a major influx
          for Idaho Falls and surrounding towns.
          <br /><br />“We feel like we’re primed to see a boom,” Cramer said.
          “The biggest booms we’ve had are when the INL came to town. We doubled
          not only in population but in landmass. ... We might not double in
          population, that might be farfetched over the next decade, but it’s
          also not unthinkable.”<br /><br />Cramer pegs Idaho Falls’ current
          population in the mid to high 60,000 range, which would put it about
          14 percent higher than its 2010 Census of 56,813. The Census Bureau
          estimated the city’s population at 61,535 in 2018. That put it as the
          state’s fourth-largest city and largest outside of the Treasure
          Valley. Eastern Idaho continues to log steady growth, with towns such
          as Ammon growing at nearly twice the rate as Idaho Falls. Ammon topped
          16,000 for the first time in 2019. <br /><br />

          The amount of recent growth is not a surprise to Ammon Mayor Sean
          Coletti.<br /><br />
          “I think that’s totally consistent with what I’ve expected and
          experienced for the city,” Coletti said. Constant growth has its
          pluses but also brings with it challenges. One issue is housing
          affordability.<br /><br />
          “I’ve worked for the city for 15 years, and it was always a great
          point of pride that we had such a low cost of living,” Cramer said.
          “And that’s not necessarily true anymore — at least right now it’s
          not. We can’t just keep thinking that we’ll keep building subdivision
          after subdivision after subdivision. There will be a market for that,
          but it can’t be the only thing we do.”
