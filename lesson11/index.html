          WINTER STORM WARNING: <br />East Idaho in the crosshairs of big
          multi-day storm
        </h2>

          <img

          />
          The National Weather Service has escalated its winter storm watches to
          winter storm warnings in anticipation of a powerful multi-day
          snowstorm that's forecast to hit East Idaho starting late Tuesday
          night. Winter weather advisories have also been issued for East Idaho
          urging motorists in the region to drive carefully because of the
          expected hazardous road conditions caused by the storm. <br />
          <br />The snow is expected to start falling on East Idaho late Tuesday
          night and to continue through Friday evening, the weather service
          said. The weather service is telling motorists that if they must
          travel in East Idaho during the storm to make sure they have "an extra
          flashlight, food and water" in their vehicles "in case of an
          emergency." In addition to dumping several inches of snow on much of
          the region, the storm is forecast to bring winds of up to 35 mph to
          East Idaho, massively decreasing visibility and causing the
          "overwhelming drifting of snow," the weather service said.

          <br />
          <br />Temporary road closures are possible in East Idaho because of
          the snowstorm. The areas forecast to receive the most snow — up to a
          foot — are Spencer, Arco, Craters of the Moon, Island Park, Ashton and
          Victor. The weather service said it’s even possible that the higher
          mountains in those areas could receive up to 18 inches of snow
          depending on the storm’s ferocity.
