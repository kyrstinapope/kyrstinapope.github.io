        <p>
          Cal Ranch Store's Website is a great example of white space. There may
          be alot going on on the front page but it breaks it up well and gives
          you enough white space to rest your eyes. It also has a clean,
          organized design. You can clearly tell the purpose they are trying to
          get across.
