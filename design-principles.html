    <p>
      Cal Ranch Store's Website is a great example of white space. There may be
      alot going on on the front page but it breaks it up well and gives you
      enough white space to rest your eyes. It also has a clean, organized
      design. You can clearly tell the purpose they are trying to get across.

      Ponies to Pearls also doesn't have alot going on but the little is does
      have makes sure that you can tell which parts go together. You can tell
      which products the owner has marked as "ARTIST FAVORITES".
