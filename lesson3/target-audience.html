      <h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
      <p>
        My target audience consists of everyone in the state of Idaho. This site
        is great for people who live in or near Preston, Soda Springs or Fish
        Haven. But it is also great for people just passing through Idaho. They
        may want to know the weather for save travel or they may want something
        to get them out of the car to have fun with their family while on their
        way to somewhere else. Either way, its perfect for everyone!
      </p>
      <h2>Persona 1</h2>
      <p>
        Jim grew up in Preston but he has always been busy with his farm and has
        never had time to participate in town events. so now that his Great
        Uncle Bob is coming to visit from North Carolina, Jim would like to find
        out what the weather and town activities are for the weekend so that he
        can take Bob and his family out to have a great time! He sits down at
        his computer to plan the perfect weekend for Bob's family.
      </p>
      <h2>Persona 2</h2>
      <p>
        Nathan and Nichole have been driving for 3 days across the country with
        their 4 kids. They are from Florida but they are traveling to California
        to visit Grandma May for Summer Vacation. After 3 days in the car,
        everyone needs a break and to stretch their legs! They happen to pass
        through Soda Springs around lunch time and decide it's a great time to
        stop for lunch. After everyone eats, they are still not ready to all
        cram in the mini-van so they decide to see what town events are
        happening. Nathan pulls out his cell phone to look up the Soda Springs
        website.
      </p>
      <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
      <p>
        Jim Needs to know the weather to know if he needs to water his crops
        that day or if it will rain.
      </p>
      <h2>Scenario 2</h2>
      <p>
        Jim wants to take the girl down the street on a date. He wants to know
        if there is a town event he can take her too and if it'll be warm enough
        that evening to go on an even walk.
      </p>
      <h2>Scenario 3</h2>
      <p>
        Nathan and Nichole need something to help get their children's energy
        out before getting back into the car to continue their road trip.
      </p>
      <h2>Scenario 4</h2>
      <p>
        Nathan rememebers stopping in a small town in Idaho on his way to his
        Grandma's as a kid and wants to show his kids some of his favorite
        memories. He can't rememeber the name of the fishing hole he went to so
        he looks it up on Preston's event website.
      </p>
      <h2>Scenario 5</h2>
      <p>
        Nichole is looking to move her family closer to their grandparents and
        looking for a location that has great weather and great family
